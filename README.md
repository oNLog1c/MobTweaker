# MobTweaker
There is a problem that everyone used to ignore and take for granted: meaningless and useless monsters that spawns where no one can find them. They fill the mobcap, and as a result, players can sometimes meet only a couple of monsters during the night. MobTweaker fixes this by looking for useless monsters and despawning them. Everyone stays satisfied: your server is much easier to breathe, because now there is no such disgusting ballast anymore, your players will begin to adore the nights due to hordes of monsters, and you, as an administrator, will be glad that you have creative mode. Otherwise you would have been eaten.
